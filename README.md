# Automate Deployment

A fully automated CI/CD pipeline for building, testing, and deploying containerized applications. This project demonstrates how to integrate Docker and GitHub Actions to streamline the development workflow from code commit to deployment.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Containerized application using Docker
- ⚙️ CI/CD pipeline setup with GitHub Actions
- 🧪 Automated testing and linting
- 🚀 Continuous deployment on every push to the main branch
- 📦 Environment-specific deployment support

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Docker** – for containerizing the application
- **GitHub Actions** – for CI/CD workflows
- **Shell scripts** – for build and deploy automation (if any)
- **(Optional)** AWS / Heroku / Render – for deployment
- **(Optional)** Kubernetes – for orchestration
